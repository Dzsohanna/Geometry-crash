Geometry Crash is a 3D skill-based game where the player must avoid obstacles while trying to achieve the highest score possible. The game was developed in Unity and uses C# scripts. 
During the gameplay, the player controls a cube that can move left and right. The obstacles gradually come at a faster pace, increasing the challenge. 
The game menu provides options to adjust the volume, restart the game, or exit. Potential future improvements include adding new obstacles, levels, and collectible items.
